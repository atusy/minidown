# minidown 0.0.4

* `mini_document` experimentally gains the `toc_highlight` argument with default value `FALSE`, which highlights the **floating** table of contents according to the browser's viewport. This feature requires `toc = TRUE` and `toc_float = TRUE` (#26).
* Internal file structures have refactored (#26).
* `mini_document` experimentally gains the `tabset` argument with default value `FALSE`, which converts the sections to tabs if they belong to the `tabset`-class section just like `rmarkdown::html_document`. The major difference from `rmarkdown::html_document` is that the names of tabs appear in table of contents, and are accessible by URL. (#27).
* Fixed a conflict among the `toc_highlight` and `tabset` arguments of `mini_document` (#28).
* Add the `section_divs` argument to the `mini_document` function. The default value is `TRUE`. It must be `TRUE` when enabling the tabset feature (#29).

# minidown 0.0.3

* The code folding feature is re-implemented. The previous implementation used five hooks on the chunk options: "class.source", "class.output", "class.message", "class.warning", "class.error". The new implementation uses a single hook on the "engine" chunk option. This allows the "class.*" chunk options be `NULL` as their default values, which is consistent with `rmarkdown::html_document()`. The previous implementation required the default values be blank string "" in order to trigger the hooks.
* The `collapse` option gains priority to the code folding feature for outputs, messages, warnings, and errors. In the future, the internal tricks will be removed by reflecting the upcoming knitr 1.31 (#22, #24).
* Layouts
  * Fixed css jitter by `a.button:hover` on the sakura framework (thanks, @jmbuhr, #20)
  * Removed the following classes from code blocks generated by chunks: `chunk-source`, `chunk-output`, `chunk-message`, `chunk-warning`, and `chunk-error`.
  * Removed a border from the floating ToC (#17)
* Bug fix
  * Internal `check_pandoc_version()` warned even if systems have Pandoc >= 2.7.2 (thanks, @eddelbuettel, #19).

# minidown 0.0.2

* New features
  * `mini_document()` adds `results_folding` option to fold entire results including figures and tables.
  * `mini_document()` adds `code_download` option
  * Add `download_rmd_button()` so that users can place a download button anywhere
    in the document.
  * `mini_document()` warns if Pandoc is older than expected. Especially, if Pandoc < 2.0, `--lua-filters` pandoc argument is omitted.
* Template and layouts
  * On template, Elements after `include-before` and `include-after` are wrapped by `<main>`
    element. Accordingly, `mini_document(toc_float = TRUE)` applies CSS Grid Layout on `<main>` element and its contents. In this way, users can safely include additional contents.
  * For the consistency with `mini_document(code_folding = TRUE)`, the max-width of body become 900px when `code_folding = FALSE`
* Bug fix
  * fix `self_contained: false` not working properly
  * exclude `toc_float`-related CSS if the `toc` option is `FALSE` (#15).
